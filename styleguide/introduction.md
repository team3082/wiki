# Programming Styleguide

## Introduction

This document serves as a guide to follow for **programming styling**. Styling is important because it allows readers to focus on the *content* of the program, and not any stylistic differences. This is especially important when working on a collaborative team, as code is frequently edited, checked, and merged by different programmers. Thus, it is necessary to establish common standards that any member of the team should follow when writing code for Team 3082. However, please remember that styling is subjective, so any rules that we use here might not be carried over to future projects or jobs.
